## [1.0.1] - 16 February 2025

Make improvment in documentations.

## [1.0.0] - 15 February 2025

- **Performance:** Significantly improved performance by optimizing the repainting strategy. The `SketchyText` widget now only repaints the necessary portions of the text, leading to smoother animations and a more responsive user experience, especially for longer paragraphs and frequent updates.

- **Simplified Usage:**
  - Removed the `startDelay` property. The package now automatically manages animation timing internally based on the order of `SketchySentance` objects.
  - Provided default values for all properties in `SketchySentance`. This simplifies common use cases and allows for more concise code.
